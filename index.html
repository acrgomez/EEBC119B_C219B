<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Welcome to my TA page for EEB C119B/C219B.</p>
<p>My office hours are in TLSB 4000, tentatively Mondays 2:00 to 3:00pm. You can also schedule an appointment by email (<a href="mailto:acrgomez@ucla.edu">acrgomez@ucla.edu</a>).</p>
<p>Please bring a computer to every discussion. As a reminder, it is possible to borrow one from UCLA library.</p>

<p>Please fill out this google forms survey <a href="https://forms.gle/D1hY7V8zQzBvHpgs9" class="uri">https://forms.gle/D1hY7V8zQzBvHpgs9</a></p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-are-a-complete-r-novice" class="section level3">
<h3>If you are a complete R novice</h3>
<p><a href="http://cran.us.r-project.org/">Install R</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">Install R Studio</a>. R Studio is a free GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the R language that keeps things organized on your screen. You can use R without R Studio, but I do not recommend it.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-are-new-to-r" class="section level3">
<h3>If you are new to R</h3>
<p>Before our next discussion, read through Chapter 1 of <a href="https://moderndive.netlify.com/1-getting-started.html">A ModernDive into R and the tidyverse</a>, which explains the basics of how to use RStudio, how to run simple code, and what are R packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-are-new-ish-to-r" class="section level3">
<h3>If you are new-ish to R</h3>
<p>Here is a non-comprehensive list of coding skills that are likely to be important for this class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic operations and built-in functions</li>
<li>Basic data manipulation (data frames)</li>
<li>Writing functions</li>
<li>Using an ODE solver</li>
<li>Using random number generators</li>
<li>Basic matrix algebra (for matrix models)</li>
<li>Plotting (scatterplots, barplots, boxplots)</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Googling the error message and asking for help</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to make this class work for everyone, I will cover these topics in discussion. There is always more to know, but if you are confident about your knowledge of them, you can skip some discussion sections (more on this after we get the survey results!).</p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-are-an-advanced-r-user" class="section level3">
<h3>If you are an advanced R user</h3>
<p>If you are an experienced R user, I would like to share this resource from the RStudio team: <a href="https://rstats.wtf/">What They Forgot to Teach You About R</a></p>
<p>We will be discussing advanced skills in some discussions in this class. If you have a particular interest, something you have always wanted to understand better, let me know and I will try to incorporate it!</p>
</div>
<div id="if-you-have-coded-in-languages-other-than-r-before" class="section level3">
<h3>If you have coded in languages other than R before</h3>
<p>If you have more-than-basic experience coding in languages other than R know that I will not force you to use R, but I may not be able to help you develop your code in other languages. I still recommend taking this opportunity to learn R, since it has some unique features that can be very useful.</p>
<p>RStudio now has full Python support, which makes it easier to use R and Python together. Read more about it here: <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023654474-Installing-and-Configuring-Python-with-RStudio" class="uri">https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023654474-Installing-and-Configuring-Python-with-RStudio</a></p>
<p>For an experienced coder prespective into learning R, I recommend reading <a href="https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf">RInferno</a></p>
<p><em>Note: while other coding languages are fine, point-and-click analysis software is not going to work for this class</em></p>
